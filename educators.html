<h2>Educator Resources (In Development)</h2>
<p>The Educator Resources section is currently being developed to support teachers, caregivers, and community leaders who want to introduce Ethnic Studies in meaningful, age‑appropriate, and culturally sustaining ways. Because implementing Ethnic Studies often requires district approval, collaboration with administrators, curriculum committees, and funding support, materials for this section are being created with ongoing educator input.</p>
<p>When complete, this section will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Curriculum guides aligned to child‑development research</li>
<li>Printable lesson plans on identity, cultural traditions, migration stories, Indigenous histories, and anti‑bias awareness</li>
<li>Creative activities, art prompts, and storytelling-centered learning modules</li>
<li>Guidance for integrating multicultural education into literacy, social studies, and community learning spaces</li>
<li>Professional development suggestions for educators new to Ethnic Studies</li>
</ul>
<p>This section is informed by research showing that children begin recognizing racial differences as early as age three and begin forming identity-based assumptions in elementary school. Providing early access to inclusive stories and diverse cultural narratives helps prevent stereotypes and supports healthy identity development—especially for multiracial, immigrant, and marginalized youth.</p>
